# URL-Shortner
This project is a fully functional URL Shortener application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It allows users to input long URLs and receive a shortened version that redirects to the original link. The application mimics services like Bitly or TinyURL and includes both frontend and backend components.
